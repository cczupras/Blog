### Example Text 1
> Today we talk to the AI assistants and hope for the best. The results we get back are what we asked for. But of course you need to know how to talk to AI. If you just ask plain questions you will very fast get disappointed - but that's because you do not speak binary…
Learning to talk to an AI is like learning a new language. It is not more than that. And I think it is quite remarkable how much it is showing us the mirror - we have unlearned to give clear instructions We throw some words into the room and expect our opposite knows exactly what to do. We got lazy in writing down clear instructions. That will change - now we have our digital assistant whom we need to tell what we want - the good thing is this assistant can also take bullet points and rephrase those in proper text or prompts for us - but you need to learn to at least give some clear instructions about what you expect as the outcome. I love to play around with the different AI tools and chatbots. There is so much new stuff coming every day that you cannot hold on with the speed. But don’t get intimidated by that.

### Example Text 2
> I learned a lot this week. Currently I am working with a citizens' initiative on a statement for some new law regulations. You can imagine this is a lot of reading and understanding the drafts. Luckily it is not binary language but still hard to understand. Of course I use AI a lot in the process either to help me research or warp up text, but also to help understand the law language.
I learned that my prompts are not always the best to get the right result. So what do you do then when the AI is not answering how you would expect it? Do we speak different languages? Do I need to learn binary?


### Example Text 3
> So the questions is then how does an AI chatbot memorize things and can related to earlier conversations? Well the answer is additional context. When you ask the chatbot something you might already know that there is also a system prompt applied in the background which alters your prompt so that it fits better to the specific LLM and also adds system or master context. All of the modern AI chatbots have either a profile or preferences where you can add personal context for all prompts. I wrote about this last week when talking about master prompts. But all of them also save conversation history in a separate memory so it would be able to use more context based on historic conversations. As the context windows get bigger and bigger these days the AI bot can remember more and more things. I does not feel like the bot is losing the red line.
