# To Be Honest: When AI Makes Collaboration Messy

## The Realities of Teamwork in Political Writing
To be honest, I recently found myself knee-deep in a collaborative project that tested both my patience and my curiosity about AI. Our team was drafting a statement for a political development plan—think lots of facts, numbers, and passionate arguments, all coming from different authors. We figured, why not let AI help us merge these diverse voices into one coherent document? After all, isn’t that what these tools are supposed to be good at?

## When AI Gets It Wrong (and Why That’s Okay)
Here’s where things got interesting. I tried using several AI models to combine our three main text sections. My goal was to keep the core narrative intact while weaving in the supporting arguments and data from the other authors. But the results? Let’s just say they were less than perfect. Sentences got jumbled, numbers ended up in the wrong places, and sometimes the context just didn’t make sense anymore.

Looking back, it’s not really the AI’s fault. These models are great at predicting what comes next in a sentence, but they don’t actually understand the relationships between facts, the flow of an argument, or why certain numbers matter in a specific context. The result? Well-written but sometimes nonsensical mashups—like two unrelated statistics being combined as if they belonged together.

## The Importance of Clear Instructions (and a Bit of Manual Work)
This experience was a reality check. If you want AI to help with complex tasks like merging nuanced texts, you need to be incredibly precise with your instructions. I realized that I should have told the model to keep related sentences and data blocks together, especially when it comes to numbers. Context is everything, and AI just isn’t there yet when it comes to understanding it the way humans do.

In the end, we decided it was faster (and more effective) to manually review and integrate the texts. Sometimes, the old-fashioned way wins out. But I’m not giving up on AI—I see this as a learning opportunity. Next time, I’ll experiment with more detailed prompts and maybe even ask the AI for advice on how to structure my instructions.

## Playing Ping-Pong with AI: Continuous Improvement
One thing I love about working with AI is the “ping-pong” effect. You try something, see what happens, adjust your approach, and try again. Each round of feedback makes the result a little better. This iterative process is at the heart of both good prompting and good teamwork. It’s not about perfection—it’s about learning and improving together, whether you’re working with humans or machines.

## What’s Next? Questions for Fellow Collaborators
This experience left me with a few questions I’d love to hear your thoughts on:
- What prompting techniques have helped you get better results from AI in collaborative writing?
- How do you balance manual editing with AI assistance?
- Have you found ways to keep data and context intact when merging texts?

Let me know in the comments or reach out directly—let’s keep learning from each other!
