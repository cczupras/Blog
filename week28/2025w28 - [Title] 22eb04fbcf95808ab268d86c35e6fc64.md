## Personal Note

Wow I have only added one section as I am writing this and there is already a lot of content on this page. Both audios I have recorded to far have about 7 minutes of my voice recorded. How much can you say in 7 minutes? Well you will see if you read further.

Currently my week are fully packed with online meetings, project work, support cases and lab time. Unfortunately the human can not multitask - tried it but failed big time. That is why I think the rise of AI is amazing. It can speed up things that take long but are necessary - documentation for example. Sometimes you also want to pitch some ideas to someone and the ones you would like to talk to are not available - nowadays I chat with AI to brainstorm on ideas - you get immediate information and impulses.

Of course I don‚Äôt do everything with AI - I choose wisely - at least I try to - which tasks I do with AI. If I need to adjust a line in code or rephrase a text block in the documentation I still do that myself - this would just be a waste of energy.

This week I will also not talk about fitness or sports - I have done that a lot - this week is more about my nutrition habits and supplements. Something I have not written about here so far.

It would not be me if there was nothing new this week - well this time I had an idea to create some content by chatting with an AI about a topic that occupies my mind. Read the result in the inside AI section.

**Enjoy reading and don‚Äôt forget to leave some feedback.**

## My Technical Learnings This Week: From Handy Extensions to AI-Workflows

It‚Äôs been a turbulent week, but one filled with technical discoveries and experiments. I want to share a few things I‚Äôve been working on, from a new favorite tool to some deeper dives into automated testing and AI-powered documentation.

## My New Favorite Tool: Markdown PDF

I‚Äôve been creating a lot of Markdown files lately for newsletters and short documentation. While Markdown is fantastic for writing, I often need to share these documents in a more polished, portable format. That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon a fantastic VS Code extension:

[](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf)

[GitHub - yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf: Markdown converter for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf#readme)

It‚Äôs simple, effective, and does exactly what it says. With a quick command, I can convert my Markdown files into beautifully formatted PDFs, ready to be emailed or shared. It even handles the Mermaid diagrams I‚Äôve been embedding in my notes, which is a huge plus. You can also output to PNG or JPEG, which is useful for smaller snippets. I really like those little tools as they enhance my way of working and I do not have to switch between tools. It integrates nicely in VS Code which is the tool where I spend most of my time. Even though the extension is no longer actively developed, it works flawlessly for my needs.

Here is how it looks - on the left is the markdown article of this blog, freshly converted from the transcript. On the right is the build-in markdown preview from VS Code.

After exporting it - it looks like this - pretty neat I think. Of course this could be enhanced with some header - there is CSS support for these kind of things. Something to be explored in the coming weeks if I want to create official documentation with our company logs, etc.

## A Spark of an Idea: Embedding Docs in Business Central

This new tool sparked an idea: what if I could embed these PDFs directly into a Business Central app? Imagine having a setup guide or detailed documentation available with a single click from within the application, e.g. the setup page.

This could be a much richer experience than relying on tooltips alone. For customer-specific apps, where hosting public documentation isn't an option, embedding a PDF resource could be a clean and effective solution without building some webservice behind a paywall. It‚Äôs just an idea for now, but I already build a proof-of-concept using the new preview pdf feature:

[File.ViewFromStream(InStream, Text [, Boolean]) Method - Business Central](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/file/file-viewfromstream-method)

## Diving Deeper: The Challenge of Automated Testing

I also continued my journey with page scripting, trying to generate test code units from a YAML file. I have to be honest: I quickly learned that I‚Äôm not as deep into the topic of automated testing as I need to be.

This is a clear to-do for me for next week. I plan to dig into the Business Central Test Toolkit to properly understand how to generate automated tests from my YAML files. My goal is to get into a test-driven development (TDD) workflow. I‚Äôm convinced that writing tests as I go will not only improve the quality and maintainability of my code but also save me time in the long run when I need to make changes.

## Automating the Boring Stuff: From Voice to Scope Documents

The most exciting thing I‚Äôve been tinkering with is a new workflow for creating scope documents from requirements. The core idea is to get from a requirement to a developer-ready task as quickly as possible.

We can often explain complex ideas much faster by speaking than by writing. So, why not use that to our advantage?

My experiment looks like this:
1.  Record a conversation (with a customer or consultant) where we discuss the required functionality and processes.
2.  Extract the audio and generate a transcript.
3.  Use a custom AI prompt to transform that transcript into a structured document, like a Product Requirement Document (PRD), user story, or feature request.

I‚Äôve already tried a few different prompts and formats and gathered feedback from my colleagues. The initial results are promising, but there‚Äôs still work to do to enhance the output. 

### The Art of the Prompt: A Lesson in Refining AI Output

The main feedback I received was that the output was often too long, with too much "fluff" and repetition. This highlights a crucial lesson in the world of AI: the quality of the output is directly tied to the quality of the prompt.

My next step is to refine the structure of my prompts to create more concise and useful documents. It‚Äôs a time-consuming process of trial and error, but it‚Äôs a fascinating challenge. Getting this right could significantly speed up our workflow from idea to implementation. And the cool thing about this whole thing is that you get to talk more to other people and resonate on ideas rather then spending typing text.

# #3 Sports, Food & Health üèãÔ∏èüö¥ü•¶

## My Approach to Supplements and Vegan Nutrition

I‚Äôve talked a lot about training in recent weeks, but I think it‚Äôs time to discuss a topic I get asked about all the time: supplements. As someone who follows a vegan lifestyle and is very active, questions about nutrition, deficiencies, and what I take to stay healthy are pretty common.

So today, I want to share my honest, no-hype approach to supplements.

## My Foundation: A "Basic Insurance" Policy

First things first: I am vegan for ethical reasons, which means I avoid animal products in my diet and lifestyle. When I first made the switch, I dove deep into nutrition to understand what my body needs, especially since I love sports and want to stay fit and healthy for the long haul or like I often say ‚Äúkick ass in my 80s, 90s ‚Ä¶

To cover my bases, I take an all-in-one supplement from Watson Nutrition. I think of it as a "basic insurance" policy. It‚Äôs a simple capsule that contains the most important nutrients that can be harder or impossible to get on a vegan diet.

But let‚Äôs be clear: this is just the foundation. It‚Äôs a supplement, not a replacement for a healthy diet. I still focus on eating whole foods‚Äîfruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains are staples in my daily meals. I‚Äôll be the first to admit I could probably use a bit more green leafy vegetables - we all have our weaknesses.

## The Great Protein Powder Debate

Since I do a lot of sports, I also have a vegan protein powder on hand. I usually mix it into my morning muesli or have a quick shake when I‚Äôm commuting.

In the past, I was diligent about having a protein shake right after every workout, just like all the fitness YouTubers recommend. But honestly? I haven‚Äôt noticed a significant difference. I‚Äôve experimented with timing and different protocols, and for my goals‚Äîwhich are more about endurance and overall fitness than building massive muscle‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt seem to be a game-changer.

My experience has taught me that as long as I eat a reasonably balanced diet and give my body enough energy, it performs just fine. I have no deficiencies‚Äîsomething I confirm with regular blood tests‚Äîso I don‚Äôt stress about it.

## The One Supplement That Made a Real Difference: Magnesium

While I‚Äôm skeptical about the hype around many supplements, there is one that has had a clear and positive impact for me: magnesium.

As a cyclist, I used to suffer from frequent cramps in my legs and feet, especially at night. It was frustrating and painful. On a recommendation, I started taking a Triple Magnesium supplement, and the difference has been remarkable. The cramps are virtually gone.

My guess is that I was deficient from sweating a lot during exercise, and maybe my coffee habit wasn't helping either. Taking magnesium in the evening has not only solved the cramp issue but also seems to improve my sleep quality. It‚Äôs a simple, effective addition that has genuinely helped.

## Listen to Your Body

My journey with nutrition and supplements has taught me one key lesson: you have to listen to your body. I already mentioned this last week - it is so important - because you know your body best. It‚Äôs not your smartwatch or any AI that gives you recommendations - it is simply just you. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in what others are doing or what‚Äôs trending online, but ultimately, you have to find what works for you. For me, that means a solid whole-food diet, a basic multi-nutrient for peace of mind, and magnesium for a specific, noticeable benefit.

**What‚Äôs your take on supplements?** Have you found something that makes a real difference for you? Let me know in the comments!

# #4 Inside AI ü§ñ

## A conversation about the future

In the last blogs I have written a lot about insights of AI and how it technically works. As a constant learner and user of AI I‚Äôm of course interested but I‚Äôm not going technically deep in the mathematics. Also there is so much happening around this topic that it is impossible to follow it. I thought it would be nice to have a little philosophical talk about the future of AI and where I think it is going. Of course I‚Äôm biased by the podcasts, videos and other blog articles that I consume but I also experience these changes in my day to day life.

So I took [claude.ai](http://claude.ai) and had a chat - here is a wrap up of the result:

### The Future of AI: From Tools to Thinking Partners

AI's most transformative potential isn't in automating tasks‚Äîit's in helping us think better.

We're moving toward a future where everyone has an AI sparring partner for refining ideas and clarifying problems. Instead of jumping straight to solutions, we'll have on-demand dialogue partners that challenge assumptions, reframe questions, and help us articulate what we're actually trying to solve.

I've been experimenting with this approach in my own work, using AI to convert meeting transcripts into developer specifications. But here's the interesting part: through iterative feedback, I trained the AI to improve not just the specs, but the original prompts themselves. The AI learned from our collaborative refinement process (well that is not entirely correct - right now I have no possibility to train the AI - but by adjusting my instructions and system prompts it is somehow similar to training).

This represents a shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a thinking partner." The real value emerges in that back-and-forth dialogue where problems get progressively clearer and solutions become more focused.

While working on that back an forth dialog I realized how we are always looking for the quick and easy solution. Now that we have a technology where we can just ask - we expect that we ask a simple question and get a massive output because AI will solve the issue - well that is not the case as a lot of boundary conditions are not clear and specified.

The future of AI isn't about replacing human thinking‚Äîit's about amplifying it through better questions, deeper exploration, and more rigorous problem definition. Soon, having an AI sparring partner will be as common as having access to a search engine.

**The question isn't whether AI will get smarter. It's whether we'll get better at thinking alongside it.**

# #5 Media of the week üé∂üì∫

Whenever a song from this band pops up in my playlist I get excited. The voice of the female vocalist is really great and in-depth. You can really hear the power on this live album. Hope I can make it to a concert soon - they are in Germany this year.

Slowly the session recordings from BC TechDays 2025 get public on the YouTube playlist. One that I can really recommend to see where the humas still makes a difference in developing software:

I asked Google NotebookLM to wrap this up

</aside>

- **Summary of the session in a couple words**
    
    This video, "AL Development in the AI Era," presents a compelling challenge between two approaches to developing a brewery management app in Business Central: **AI-only "vibe coding"** by a pretended junior developer (Dimitri) and a **traditional, experienced-based "handcrafted" method** (AJ).
    
    Key learnings and insights from Dimitri's journey using AI agents in Cursor include:
    
    - **The critical importance of context for AI**. Initial attempts at "vibe coding" failed due to a lack of technical context, resulting in generic, old-fashioned, or incorrect code. Providing detailed context through development plans, coding standards, and specific instructions (e.g., using rules generated from AL patterns websites) significantly improves AI's output.
    - **Teaching AI new knowledge** is possible and beneficial. Dimitri demonstrated feeding AI transcribed webinar content and automatically generated code documentation (e.g., for the REST Client) to enable it to implement features it initially didn't understand. This knowledge can then be solidified into **reusable "rules" for continuous improvement** in future AI-generated code.
    - **AI struggles significantly with business logic** and understanding complex processes. While it can generate setup and import data, implementing business rules like keg tracking and refunds required extensive back-and-forth iteration and human intervention to escape a "please fix loop". Tips for this include referring to base app code, summarising failures, using Git for rollbacks, and starting new chats for new features.
    - **AI-generated code lacks inherent security and best practices**. For example, AI exposed all customer data via APIs without security filters, highlighting the need for human oversight and validation.
    - **Testing is non-negotiable** when using AI for development. AI can generate tests, but these tests often reveal critical flaws in the AI-generated code, making them a crucial tool for developers to understand errors and take responsibility for the final product.
    
    AJ's handcrafted approach showcased the value of deep understanding and experience, particularly in:
    
    - **Thoroughly understanding business requirements and accounting implications** before coding. This allowed for leveraging standard Business Central features and writing minimal, highly effective code.
    - **Implementing robust security measures** by designing specific permission sets and data filtering for APIs.
    
    The audience poll indicated that a **"blend brew" ‚Äì a combination of AI assistance and human expertise ‚Äì is the preferred and most effective approach** to AL development in the AI era. The speakers conclude that AI excels at generating code for APIs, tests, and documentation, but a "captain" (experienced developer) is still needed to guide the "co-pilot" due to AI's limitations in understanding complex business logic, Business Central internals, and latest AL features. The presentation also touches on advanced topics like using AI for data insights and upcoming AI models and tools.
