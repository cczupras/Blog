# To Be Honest: My Approach to Supplements and Vegan Nutrition

I’ve talked a lot about training in recent weeks, but I think it’s time to discuss a topic I get asked about all the time: supplements. As someone who follows a vegan lifestyle and is very active, questions about nutrition, deficiencies, and what I take to stay healthy are pretty common.

So today, I want to share my honest, no-hype approach to supplements.

## My Foundation: A "Basic Insurance" Policy

First things first: I am vegan for ethical reasons, which means I avoid animal products in my diet and lifestyle. When I first made the switch, I dove deep into nutrition to understand what my body needs, especially since I love sports and want to stay fit and healthy for the long haul.

To cover my bases, I take an all-in-one supplement from Watson Nutrition. I think of it as a "basic insurance" policy. It’s a simple capsule that contains the most important nutrients that can be harder to get on a vegan diet.

But let’s be clear: this is just the foundation. It’s a supplement, not a replacement for a healthy diet. I still focus on eating whole foods—fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains are staples in my daily meals. I’ll be the first to admit I could probably use a bit more green leafy vegetables, but it’s all a work in progress.

## The Great Protein Powder Debate

Since I do a lot of sports, I also have a vegan protein powder on hand. I usually mix it into my morning muesli or have a quick shake when I’m commuting.

In the past, I was diligent about having a protein shake right after every workout, just like all the fitness YouTubers recommend. But honestly? I haven’t noticed a significant difference. I’ve experimented with timing and different protocols, and for my goals—which are more about endurance and overall fitness than building massive muscle—it doesn’t seem to be a game-changer.

My experience has taught me that as long as I eat a reasonably balanced diet and give my body enough energy, it performs just fine. I have no deficiencies—something I confirm with regular blood tests—so I don’t stress about it.

## The One Supplement That Made a Real Difference: Magnesium

While I’m skeptical about the hype around many supplements, there is one that has had a clear and positive impact for me: magnesium.

As a cyclist, I used to suffer from frequent cramps in my legs and feet, especially at night. It was frustrating and painful. On a recommendation, I started taking a Triple Magnesium supplement, and the difference has been remarkable. The cramps are virtually gone.

My guess is that I was deficient from sweating a lot during exercise, and maybe my coffee habit wasn't helping either. Taking magnesium in the evening has not only solved the cramp issue but also seems to improve my sleep quality. It’s a simple, effective addition that has genuinely helped.

## Listen to Your Body

My journey with nutrition and supplements has taught me one key lesson: you have to listen to your body. It’s easy to get caught up in what others are doing or what’s trending online, but ultimately, you have to find what works for you. For me, that means a solid whole-food diet, a basic multi-nutrient for peace of mind, and magnesium for a specific, noticeable benefit.
