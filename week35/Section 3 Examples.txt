## The Importance of Sleep

### When Sleep Slips, Everything Feels Off

Let‚Äôs be honest: sleep is one of those things we all know is important, but it‚Äôs easy to underestimate just how much it impacts everything else. This week, I had a rough night‚Äîpersonal reasons, not much rest‚Äîand I felt it immediately. My focus was off, my energy dipped, and even my workouts took a hit. At Saturday‚Äôs CrossFit birthday session, my performance just wasn‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs humbling how quickly a lack of sleep can ripple through your days.

### Why Deep Sleep Matters (and How Much You Really Need)

If you look at the research, it‚Äôs pretty clear: most adults need about 7‚Äì9 hours of sleep to get enough deep sleep (slow-wave-sleep) phases. That‚Äôs when the real magic happens‚Äîmuscle repair, hormone regulation - open the hormone expand below for some nerd details. Those tiny muscle tears from training? They‚Äôre patched up while you sleep. It‚Äôs all part of the body‚Äôs natural recovery process, and it only works if you give yourself enough time in bed.

- **hormone nerd details during deep sleep**
    - **Growth Hormones (HGH)**: Released in greater amounts during sleep, especially in **deep sleep (Slow-Wave Sleep) and REM sleep**, essential for tissue regeneration, muscle building, and bone strengthening. Reduced by sleep deprivation or interruptions.
    - **Testosterone**: Also released during sleep, important for muscle regeneration and repair.
    - **Cortisol (Stress Hormone)**: Production significantly **reduces during sleep**. **Insufficient sleep leads to increased cortisol levels**. High cortisol inhibits muscle growth and repair, promotes muscle breakdown and fat storage, and hinders healing processes.
    - **Melatonin**: Produced during sleep, helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle.
    - **Insulin Sensitivity**: Affected by sleep; lack of sleep makes it harder to build muscle and burn fat.
    - **Ghrelin and Leptin**: Sleep deprivation can disrupt these hunger/satiety hormones, potentially leading to increased hunger and poor food choices.

### Building Better Sleep Habits: What Actually Helps

I‚Äôm not perfect here, but I‚Äôve learned a few things that make a difference:

- **Limit screen time before bed.** The blue light from phones and laptops really does mess with your sleep cycles. I try to swap the screen for a book in the evening.
- **Create a relaxing routine.** Sometimes it‚Äôs a bit of calm music, sometimes a short meditation or gentle yoga. Anything that helps the body and mind wind down. (personal note: I have not found my best routine yet.)
- **Keep it dark and cool.** I use a sleep mask, especially in summer when the early sunrise can sneak in. It‚Äôs a small thing, but it helps me stay asleep longer and calmer.

### What I‚Äôm Still Figuring Out

I know there‚Äôs more to learn about sleep‚Äîlike the different phases, and how to optimize each one. Maybe next time we talk about sleep I‚Äôll dig into the science a bit more and share some practical tips. For now, I‚Äôm focusing on the basics: more rest, better routines, and paying attention to how I feel.

### Your Turn: How‚Äôs Your Sleep?

How do you handle nights when you just can‚Äôt get enough rest? Any tips or routines that work for you? Drop a comment or share your experience‚ÄîI‚Äôm always looking to learn from others!

## I started Hybrid Training

What is this? If we ask https://chat.mistral.ai/chat - here is a definition:

> Hybrid training is a fitness approach that combines different types of exercises, such as strength training and endurance activities, to create a well-rounded and comprehensive workout regimen.
> 

I stumbled upon this term again after reading an article in the training magazin and after talking with a fitness buddy after he succeeded in reaching a fitness milestone of completing a 10k under 40 minutes. I was curious how he trained and he gave me some tips and influencer names. Guess what I did‚Ä¶ right put some sources into NotebookLM and created an audio description to listen to during a dog walk. After hearing it and watching some videos I figured something out‚Ä¶

Essentially, it's what I've been doing all along, focusing on strength development and endurance through high-intensity CrossFit training. This approach has always been at the core of my fitness regimen, emphasizing the importance of building strength and stamina simultaneously. I aim to broaden this approach, especially since I've been involved with HYROX over the past two years, which emphasizes running and endurance. This involvement has allowed me to explore new dimensions of fitness, pushing my limits and discovering new potentials within myself.

Over the last year, I've also taken up cycling, enjoying longer rides on my gravel bike. This newfound passion has not only added variety to my training routine but has also provided a refreshing way to experience the outdoors. Cycling has become a significant part of my life, complementing my existing training methods and contributing to my overall fitness journey. It's amazing how incorporating different activities can enhance one's physical capabilities and mental well-being.

As I continue to evolve in my fitness journey, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. By integrating various forms of exercise, I am confident that I can achieve a well-rounded and balanced approach to health and fitness. This holistic perspective not only keeps my workouts interesting but also ensures that I am constantly challenging myself and striving for improvement.

The last years I have not spend much attention to specific training plans or specific goals. I just went to classes and hit whatever the WOD (workout of the day) was. Occasionally I went running or did some lifting in my garage gym.

This will change as I want to experience how training evolves when working to specific goals with a plan. Starting with more attention to the data I am tracking about myself I will also plan the training sessions accordingly.

Hybrid Training I figured out is closest to the method how I would like to train. So here is the plan:

### Weekly Training Plan üìà

**Training Days (4-5 days)**

1. **Monday: Strength Training**
    - Focus: Deadlift and Squats
    - Goal: Build strength and increase weight
    - Additional: 5 sets of push-ups with 2-minute breaks
        - Use breaks for mobility exercises focusing on hips and shoulders
2. **Tuesday: Running**
    - Longer running session or interval training
    - Optional: Replace with bike sprints, especially uphill
3. **Wednesday: HYROX Training**
    - Attend a HYROX class at CrossFit Flensburg
    - High-intensity training to prepare for HYROX
4. **Thursday: Active Rest or Mobility Session**
    - Bike ride at a moderate, easy pace (Level 2 or lower)
    - Focus on mobility exercises, especially for hips and shoulders
5. **Friday: Biking**
    - Biking session depending on time and training fatigue from the week
    - Additional: 5 sets of push-ups with 2-minute breaks
        - Use breaks for mobility exercises focusing on hips and shoulders
6. **Saturday: Partner Workout (WOD)**
    - High-intensity interval training with a partner
    - Include a variety of exercises for a comprehensive workout
7. **Sunday: Rest Day**
    - Completely passive or active rest, depending on how I feel

### ‚û°Ô∏è Key Points & Goals:

- **Push-ups Goal**: Aim to do 100 push-ups unbroken.
- **Squat Goal:** 5 x 100kg back squat
- **Running Goal:** Half marathon in under 2:00 hours
- **Mobility**: Incorporate more mobility sessions throughout the week to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.
- **Hybrid Training Focus**: Emphasize strength, high-intensity interval training, running, and mobility.

## Umami smoked tofu gyros üî•

This week I will share a simple but tasty recipe for tofu. You basically only need a block of firm smoked tofu and an asparagus peeler.

Take a bowl, peel slice by slice of the tofu. 

Season it with soy sauce, garlic, onions and your favorite herbs. Optionally add some Sriracha sauce for extra spice. 

Stir fry in a medium hot pan with some oil until crispy. 

Enjoy in a fresh bread with cucumber, Tzatziki and tomatoes or just eat it with rice or french fries. 

Original idea can be found here (German):

## Train and Brain üß†

One question that occupied my mind this week was:

> Is There a Correlation Between Fitness Training, Memory Performance, and Mental Strength?
> 

After some research the answer is:

> **Yes, there is a well-established correlation between regular fitness training, improved memory performance, and enhanced mental strength.**
> 

---

- I experienced it myself when starting ‚Ä¶
    
    with CrossFit training and in general more fitness training. After some nasty workouts that we endured in several CrossFit classes at CrossFit Flensburg I realized that I could memorize things easier and that I was able to work through hard tasks at work because I knew I could do it and in the end the endorphins would kick in when the task was finished, just like it feels after a workout ended.
    
    Based on the sources I found to find proof for what I assumed here is a deeper wrap up on how the different elements are connected through training:
    
    ### 1. **Fitness Training and Memory Performance**
    
    Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that regular physical activity positively impacts various aspects of cognitive function, especially memory. Here‚Äôs how:
    
    - **Improved Blood Flow:** Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, delivering more oxygen and nutrients that are essential for optimal brain function.
    - **Neurogenesis:** Physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise (like running, cycling, or swimming), stimulates the production of new neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory.
    - **Neurotransmitter Balance:** Exercise boosts the levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which play a role in attention, motivation, and memory formation.
    - **Cognitive Test Performance:** Studies have found that individuals who are physically fit tend to perform better on cognitive tests measuring information processing speed, working memory, and episodic memory.
    
    ### Research Highlights:
    
    - **Moderate Intensity:** Regular moderate exercise (like brisk walking or cycling) has been linked to better performance in episodic memory tasks (remembering events and experiences).
    - **High Intensity:** More intense workouts seem to particularly benefit spatial memory (the ability to remember locations and navigate environments).
    
    ### 2. **Fitness Training and Mental Strength**
    
    Mental strength-often described as resilience, willpower, and the ability to cope with stress-also benefits significantly from regular exercise:
    
    - **Stress Reduction:** Physical activity lowers levels of stress hormones (like cortisol) and increases endorphins, which are natural mood elevators.
    - **Emotional Regulation:** Exercise can help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, leading to a more stable and positive mood.
    - **Building Discipline:** Sticking to a workout routine fosters discipline, perseverance, and self-confidence, all of which are key components of mental strength.
    - **Coping Skills:** Overcoming physical challenges in training helps individuals build resilience and better cope with setbacks in other areas of life.
    
    ### 3. **Overall Well-being**
    
    People who exercise regularly often report:
    
    - Better sleep quality
    - Enhanced focus and concentration
    - Greater self-esteem
    - Improved ability to manage daily stressors
    
    ### **Facts Conclusion**
    
    **Regular fitness training is strongly correlated with both improved memory performance and greater mental strength.** The benefits are not limited to any age group and can be seen across various types and intensities of exercise. Incorporating regular physical activity into your lifestyle is one of the most effective ways to support both your mental and cognitive health.
    
    ### My personal conclusion
    
    I can totally relate to the mentioned elements, I have experienced almost all of the above. I think without the training and sportive activity I would be less what I am today. I do not like to be lazy or just sit around I always feel the urge to move. And I also feel the urge to move better.
    
    I really believe that if you want a long healthy life then exercise and a proper nutrition is the way to go.
