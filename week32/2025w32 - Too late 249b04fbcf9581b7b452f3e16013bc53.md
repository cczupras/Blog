## Personal Note

It is already Tuesday as I‚Äôm writing this - too days after publishing deadline on Sunday that I had set myself for each week this year. I just did not find the time because other things like my wedding anniversary had priority. Sometimes you have to do the right choices.

However I had prepared some thoughts for this week and also some content and of course that will be written down here and saved in my second brain.

**Enjoy reading and don‚Äôt forget to leave some feedback.**

# #2 Tech üíª

## Tools, Tools, Tools ‚Ä¶ üõ†Ô∏è

The beginning of the year started with a steep learning curve in new technologies. I learned a lot of new tools, workflows and best practices and this was exiting. Every week something new. 

Well not all new things last.

The last weeks I found it harder not to repeat myself in this section and write about something new. My aim is to provide you as a reader with interessting valuable content and not just everyday lines of code.

Over the last weeks I have collected quite a bunch of tools or build some on my own. In the bigger context it is now time to sit back and reflect on which tools have worked best and brought value to my everyday life - especially the work part of life as this consumes most of my time spent with technology.

It is time to build something up that really helps me be more productive and make the most out of my time. What would that be? - to be honest I have no idea yet‚Ä¶

But, there is a slight thought in my head that I cannot really grab yet - I can feel there is something brewing. I guess the right thing to do here is to make some time and write down which tools I use most often, how I use them and how to plug these together.

They way I envision it now is to create a new notebook in one of my favorite tools:  

https://notebooklm.google.com/

It recently got a huge update - the studio section now is more versatile and you are able to generate more than one audio overview (aka podcast) and even a new video overview. That is really exiting. I use the notebook quite often to collect ideas and material for a certain topic, I even started to have a notebook on the side of a book - where I can wrap up chapters before reading them to get into the summed up content - which helps me getting deeper into the topic. What I find also really helpful is the mind map - just extracts the right bullet points and when clicking on them it drives you to the text in the sources where it was derived from.

There are a lot of people out there that create great content - which I have just touched at the surface - and logged into my second brain. I guess it is now time to go deeper, tinker around and build something valuable and great out of it - may be by the end of the year I will have written about it - who knows. If you are curious stay tuned.

**Do you have big ideas or tool suggestions - bring them along and get in touch - love to hear from you.**

# #3 Sports, Food & Health üèãÔ∏èüö¥ü•¶

## All that gear ‚öôÔ∏è

This week while I was running a longer run trying to train with nose-breathing only it came to my mind how much of gear I use during training. When going for a run, I strap on my heart-rate breast belt, wear my Garmin watch, of course use proper running shoes and socks to not get any blisters, then I have a sweat wrist band and now I even have two new tools:

- some shokz open run pro 2 bluetooth headphones which work with bone resonance
- a nasal dilator - an insert for the nose so that you get more air in - similar to a nose plaster

Both things are game changers to me. With the shokz I can listen to the songs that drive me forward without risking to overhear a car or bike - the cool thing with these head phones is that the ear stays free and I can hear all surrounding sound and noise.

The nasal dilator helps me breathing - I have some allergies in the summer and my nose is always a bit swelling - especially when doing sport. 

With the insert the nose stays a bit more open and I can breath easier. It turned out that my heart rate is also a bit lower when just breathing through the nose.

No fancy things but it helps me stay motivated for the run and other endurance sports. After some tests I feel that the nose insert is really helping getting more oxygen in which of course helps not to fatigue too fast.

**Are you using any special gear for your sports - let me know - I‚Äôm all ears.**

### AI Agents & The Data Revolution: A Look at Tomorrow's Workflow

This week has been quite a journey into the fascinating world of AI, and I‚Äôve been reflecting on some truly eye-opening insights. Diving into a couple of podcasts and articles, I started to connect the dots on how **AI agents** and **Managed Communication Protocols (MCPs)** are rapidly changing how we think about productivity and data. It‚Äôs more than just new tools; it‚Äôs about a fundamental shift in how we work and learn. You know how much I love finding ways to make things a little bit better, and this week has shown me a path to even more efficient workflows, especially with data that needs to stay private.

I‚Äôm always eager to learn from others, and this topic has really sparked my curiosity. So, I hope this deep dive provides some inspiration for your own work and daily routines.

### Understanding AI Agents: More Than Just Chatbots

When we talk about **AI agents**, it‚Äôs easy to think of simple chatbots that just answer questions. But from what I've learned, they are so much more! An AI agent is actually an AI system designed to achieve a **specific goal by performing actions** and adapting its decisions based on information it actively seeks out and perceives. Think of it as an AI that acts rather than merely reacts. This goes beyond just giving you a response; it‚Äôs about empowering the AI to **‚Äúthink‚Äù and ‚Äúplan‚Äù** using language, and then adapting its next steps based on what it has just done or found. This capability allows for complex, almost autonomous workflows.

**Key characteristics and examples of what makes an AI agent powerful:**

- **Action-Oriented:** If you ask an agent to research an article behind a paywall, it won‚Äôt just give up. Instead, it might proactively search social media or other free news sites to piece together the information for you.
- **Self-Correction:** Agents can refine their approach. They learn from previous interactions, almost like a "ping-pong" effect where you try something, see the outcome, adjust, and try again. This iterative process is crucial for getting better results.
- **Strengths in Text:** They are really good at processing text, summarizing content, generating creative text, and combining information from various sources. This is something I've personally experienced when using AI to summarize my audio notes for this blog.
- **Challenges:** Agents still struggle with understanding visual interfaces (like a calendar widget in LinkedIn) or tasks that are too vague. It‚Äôs also important to remember that they can make errors, even serious ones, if not properly managed. That‚Äôs why starting small and testing individual aspects of a workflow is always a good idea before trying to automate an entire process.

### MCP: The Universal Plug for Enterprise Data

Here‚Äôs where it gets really exciting, especially for businesses: **Managed Communication Protocol (MCP)**. This concept is described as a **"universal plug"** that connects your enterprise systems and data directly to AI models. The whole point is to cut out the tedious manual "copy-pasting" of data into AI tools, allowing the AI to access the information it needs directly. I‚Äôve talked a lot about the importance of streamlining workflows and avoiding manual steps, and MCP seems to be a huge step in that direction!

**The power of MCP lies in its ability to democratize data access and unlock new possibilities:**

- **Empowering Non-Technical Users:** Imagine people in marketing, sales, or R&D who usually rely on IT for data queries. With MCP, they can use natural language chats to retrieve and analyze information from various internal systems themselves. This really connects with my vision of giving users more control over their data and processes.
- **Unlocking Complex Queries:** You can ask "fuzzy" questions that traditional, rigid reporting systems just can't handle, like "Which articles are relevant for a late majority corporate client with 5,000 employees?".
- **Enabling Knowledge Synthesis:** MCP allows combining data from different departmental "silos" (think marketing, sales, R&D data) to create a holistic "big picture" view and generate new insights. This drastically reduces the time and effort traditionally spent on IT-dependent integration projects. This reminds me of my own second brain, where I strive to gather knowledge from various sources and connect different ideas to form new insights.
- **Integrating Legacy Systems:** Even old, complex systems like mainframe terminals or long-standing Excel spreadsheets can be integrated, allowing AI to interact with them and extract valuable information. This is a huge win for companies with long-standing infrastructure.

### The Human Element: Working *With* AI, Not Just *Through* It

While immensely powerful, working with AI agents and MCPs isn't entirely hands-off. It‚Äôs all about **human-AI collaboration**.

- **Defining the "What":** Humans still need to define what they want to achieve and what questions to ask. As I've learned, **clear and precise instructions** are key to getting the right output from AI. It's a skill we need to re-learn and hone.
- **The Feedback Loop:** Success with AI systems requires a **constant feedback loop**, treating the AI more like a colleague or a **"sparring partner"** than a deterministic machine. You provide context, observe results, and refine the instructions iteratively. This "ping-pong" effect is something I truly enjoy in my own interactions with AI.
- **Embracing Error:** We must also develop a "culture of error," accepting that AI systems, like humans, won't always be 100% accurate, especially in initial attempts. This aligns with my own experiences of letting AI do rough drafts and then refining them, or using it to debug code.
- **Constant Adaptation:** The technology is evolving so rapidly that continuous learning and adaptation are vital. My blog itself is a testament to this, as I constantly learn new things about AI and how to apply them.

Looking ahead, I expect to see more "AI-friendly" internet infrastructure and company systems, designed to make it easier for AI to navigate and utilize data. The vision includes virtual AI agent teams and company-specific "app stores" for pre-built MCP servers, making integration and data access as easy as downloading an app. This will fundamentally shift how processes are designed, moving from merely automating existing tasks to reinventing entire workflows with both human and agentic employees working together.

The message is clear: AI has largely solved its "capability problem"; the challenge now is **integration**. By embracing these tools and learning to work *with* them, not just *through* them, we can unlock unprecedented productivity and innovation.
